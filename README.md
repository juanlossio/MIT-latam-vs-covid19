# COVInfo
## Introduction
We have developed COVInfo, a knowledge platform that verifies information from scientific peer-reviewed journals in hopes of combating misinformation circulating the Internet in light of COVID-19. COVInfo will be available on GitHub, so that other developers can access it and develop their own tools to verify misinformation. With COVInfo, developers can create tools such as misinformation verifiers and search engine integrators. Unlike other knowledge graphs, COVInfo will only verify data against published scientific journals. We will first start using PubMed and then scale to include other scientific journals.

Given the circumstances of the pandemic, we want to make COVInfo accessible to the public, and it will be open source. A team of developers will help us maintain our knowledge graph and we will continue to grow with the assistance of government institutions. We encourage you to download COVInfo and start exploring ways you can tackle misinformation related to COVID-19.
